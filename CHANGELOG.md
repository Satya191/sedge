## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Documentation for all supported networks and clients.
- Support for custom networks.
- When generating new mnemonic, show it without a trace.
- Support import slashing protection interchange data [EIP-3076](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3076)
  while running the setup with the `cli` command or with the new command `slashing-import`.
- Support export slashing protection interchange data [EIP-3076](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3076)
  with the new command `slashing-export`.
- Support the new command `run`, used to run all the services generated.
- Support for PPA packaging (apt install).
- Added flag `--container-tag` to add a suffix to sedge containers name.
- Support the new command `import-key` to import validator keys in an existing configuration.
- Added Erigon support for Gnosis network

### Changed

- Updated Checkpoint Sync Url for Goerli.
- Updated installation script for docker and docker compose in Linux flavours.
- Use newed created action for JWT secret handling.
- Fixed validator restart failure. Validator never restarts, but has a better and safer start-up method:
  - Validator waits a grace period (2 epochs) before starting.
  - Validator waits for the consensus sync to finish: verifying that the `/eth/v1/node/health` consensus endpoint returns with the HTTP code 200 in the newly added `consensus-health` docker-compose service with the docker-compose `healthcheck` condition so that the validator waits for the consensus be healthy. This replace the older track sync method.
- Removed `v` from the tag on release scripts. Now we should use `Tag=v1.0.0` instead of `Tag=1.0.0`.
- Rename sedge data directory name to `sedge-data` instead of `docker-compose-scripts`.
- Refactor `sedge cli` command to use the new sedge actions in a more interactive way.
- Update mev-boost relay URLs.
